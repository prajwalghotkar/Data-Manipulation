# Data-Manipulation

## From the data provided on Hollywood movies:

1) 	Find the highest rated movie in the “Quest” story type.

2) 	Find the genre in which there has been the greatest number of movie releases

3) 	Print the names of the top five movies with the costliest budgets.

4) 	Is there any correspondence between the critics’ evaluation of a movie and its acceptance by the public? Find out, by plotting the net profitability of a movie against 
    the ratings it receives on Rotten Tomatoes.

##  Perform Operations on Files

5.1 From the raw data below create a data frame

5.2 Save the dataframe into a csv file as example.csv

5.3 Read the example.csv and print the data frame

5.4 Read the example.csv without column heading

5.5 Read the example.csv and make the index columns as 'First Name’ and 'Last Name'

5.6 Print the data frame in a Boolean form as True or False. True for Null/ NaN values and false for non-null values

5.7 Read the dataframe by skipping first 3 rows and print the data frame

5.8 Load a csv file while interpreting "," in strings around numbers as thousands seperators. Check the raw data 'postTestScore' column has, as thousands separator. Comma 
    should be ignored while reading the data. It is default behaviour, but you need to give argument to read_csv function which makes sure commas are ignored.

##  Perform Operations on Files

6.1 From the raw data below create a Pandas Series

6.2 From the raw data below create a Pandas Series

6.3 Create a series from the raw data below 'India_is_big', 'Population_is_huge', np.nan, 'Has_diverse_culture'

6.4 Create a series 

6.5 Create a series and remove dollar from the numeric values '12', '-$10', '$10,000'

6.6 Create a series and reverse all lower-case words 

6.7 Create pandas series and print true if value is alphanumeric in series or false if value is not alpha numeric in series.

6.8 Create pandas series and print true if value is containing ‘A’,'1', '2', '1a', '2b', 'America', 'VietnAm','vietnam', '2003c'

6.9 Create pandas series and print in three columns value 0 or 1 is a or b or c exists in values 'a', 'a|b', np.nan, 'a|c'

6.10 Create pandas dataframe having keys and ltable and rtable as below -
     'key': ['One', 'Two'], 'ltable': [1, 2]
     'key': ['One', 'Two'], 'rtable': [4, 5]
      Merge both the tables based of key
